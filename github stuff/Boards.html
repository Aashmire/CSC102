            ROBOTICS AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS
Robots and connected embedded digital systems provide smart solutions that extend human capabilities. Powered by
artificial intelligence and data generated in real-time by nature, people and the systems within robots and drones, the degrees
of autonomy surrounding us increase as they perform valued tasks. UATâ€™s Robotics and Embedded Systems degree provides
students with the foundation for the design, implementation and analysis of systems that make robots, drones and other
platforms viable tools. A degree in Robotics and Embedded Systems incorporates mechanical design, digital logic design,
embedded programming, machine vision, sensing, big data and artificial intelligence into developing and designing robotic
systems that solve useful problems. The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code for Robotics and Embedded
Systems is 15.0405.
