        Castle Grayskull guild is recruiting players of all classes and levels to join our ranks!
        <!--Runes of magic is based on a "duel-class system" where your primary and seconday class forms a combo with "elite skills" exclusive to that combo.
        Instances or dungeons are level specific and progress through the game until you get to the highest level known as "endgame"
        Armor and weponry referred to as "gear" in game is important to know which sets are compatible for your class combo-->

        <li>Learn from seasoned players about what class combos are important for PVE and PVP.</li>
        <li>Learn about elite skills and which ones are useful for each class combo so you don't waste precious talent points.</li>
        <li>Get help with instances to power through content and forge your own path towards endgame.</li>
        <li>Learn about gear and how to stat correctly for your class combo so you don't waste valuable resources</li>
        </ul>
